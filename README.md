# car_rental_app
This is my SE_3355 final project called "Rent-A-Car-App", which I made using Flask. 

Explanation of the project:
This project mainly requires users to rent a car from an office near them. You can register to the website with your email, username, password, country, city and additionally profile picture. Also you can login to the website with your username and password. When you login or register to the site you can see a "Welcome" message with your username. From now on we can rent a car but before that I must specify that this website has a translation mechanism from english to turkish and turkish to english. For renting a car we must select a pickup office, pickup date, pickup time, return office, return date and return time. After we click the rent button we can see the options for renting. We can also sort these options as cost, mileage, age and rental cost for ascending or descending order. Also we can filter these options by transmission. If we want to see the details of the cars we can click on them and see much more information about that specified car. The most important part about the project is at the beginning google asks our user for to reach their location and use it directly. If user give permission to use the map directly locate itself from that location. 


ASSUMPTIONS:
It says "Login with email/password or Google will be supported" in the file, so I assumed it was either one of them
It says "Web application needs to be hosted on a provider like Azure Apps, Render.com." in the file, so I assumed it could be any hosting website since it says 'like'.
